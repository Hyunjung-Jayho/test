## Safety Devices with 3D Printing

## *(수정제안?) Personal Protective Equipment(PPEs) with 3D Printing*

( Safety Devices 가 Personal Protective Equipment 보다  큰 개념의 용어이고 손 소독제는 PPE에 안 들어갈 것도 같으니까..)

* With the pandemic of COVID 19, the health workers all over the world are scrambling with the shortage of personal protective equipments(PPEs) such as masks  as well as medical devices.  Under this circumstances
* <u>To defeat the coronavirus pandemic, this project is aimed to develop and distribute the devices, which can be 향상되어 발 전 될 수 있는 것 or in unmet needs</u>
* (좀 더 강조) This project is run by M~~~~~~~~in Asan Medical Center(AMC-MI2RL), Seoul, Korea.
* Uploaded STL files are produced(제작되거나)  or modified  with 3D modelling program( 3-matics(Materialise), Solidworks s/w)
* Download or Use of uploaded STL files are free and recommended.
* For further information or questions, please contact via email: dyhong.89@gmail.com

## Medical Device Reverse Engineering

* <u>Various ideas to defeat the battle with COVID19 can be realized with 3D printing</u>
* <u>With a 수요.,..Unmet needs in frontline clinical 현장 (healthcare work place), unmet needs for medical devices can be fulfilled</u>
* <u>it can be done with following protocal</u> 
  1. get 3D image <u>through</u> CT or 3D scanner
  2. 동일한 형상의 파트 혹은 맞춤형 파트를 제작하여
  3. print with appropriate 3D printing material

### 1. Customized Mask

* this is to product personal customized mask using 3D scanning
* 특징? 장점? merit?:  low cost? cost effective? 헤파필터 교환형, sterilization available, face-fit customized( can reduce the air flow gap
* Printing with flexible materials (e.g. TPU in FDM) are recommended
* Original design of AMC-MI2RL

### 2. Forearm Door Opener

*  We propose new way of door opening. <u>This can reduce the chance of  potential exposure occuring when touching the contaminated door or door handle surface</u> with hand.

* Demo Video: https://youtu.be/Ut0sYw5X-XA
* We refered modelling of STARARASYS Corp.,  and was modified with additional modeling of MI2RL to improve <u>user  편의성? convenience and 설치 안정성.</u>
* This device first refered the original modeling of STRATAYS Corps., and modified to improve 사용자 편의와 설치 안정성 with MI2RL modelling.

* <u>Robust? Strong견고한 Acrylic materials through FDM is recommended</u>

### 3. Mobile Door Opener(mobile이 조금 어울리지 않는 것 같아서 수정을 제안합니다.)

1. ###### Keyring-type <u>untact</u> Door Opener

2. Non-hand-contact Door Opener(keyring type)

3. Portable Door Opener

* With this small device, people can minimize the <u>chance</u> of potential exposure reducing the hand contact to the possibly contaminated surfaces such as door handles(when opening/closing the door) or elevator buttons.
* This device is developed with AMC-MI2RL original modelling 
* <u>견고한 acrylic materials (e.g. PLA, ABS) through FDM is recommended</u>
* STl Link:

### 4. Mask-Strap Holder

* Wearing a mask for many hours can cause the pain behind the ear.  This  device is developed to lessen that kind of pain and also reduce the gap between face and the mask (사이즈에 맞게 조절하면서)

* Merit: Made in two type(by size?)
  * <u>Type1 : putting on around the ear, **돌기** make resistence with hairs so that not 미끄러짐. size adjustable for face size(3-step)</u>
  * <u>Type2: not 귀에 거는 방식, without 돌기 so that the contact surface on the neck is not uncomfortable, adjustable for face size</u>

* Flexible materials  such as TPU with FDM is recommended

### 5. Face/ Eye Protector

* This device is developed as a tool for protecting peoples' eyes and face from infectious 오염원/virus(respiratory droplets) by covering whole face
* Transparent acrylic sheet 
* can be used with attachment of transparent acrylic sheet<u>(OHP 필름)</u> onto the 3d printed frame.
* 3D printed frame + Transparent Acrylic sheets<u>(OHP 필름 영어?)</u>
  * (OHP films) can be attached(holded) onto the frame through the holes with 4-hole punch
  * Frame:  modified(어느 부분이? 왜?) with <u>Thingiverse Corperations' modelling design</u>, printing with strong type of materials such as PLA are recommended.
